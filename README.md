# Guessing-Game
My very first project: A number guessing game!

guessing_game.py is a guessing game where you must select a number between 1-10. It will tell you whether the answer is higher or lower so you can better formulate your guesses.



Notes:

Assistance recieved from Jennifer Nordell on Slack as to why something may or may not have worked when troubleshooting seemed to be getting nowhere. Assistance has been provided for setting 'guess' to 1000  to begin the loop, and creating a function for get_guess() instead of having it be a part of the start_game() function. Aside from writing out those two moments, I don't think anything else could be considered copying so much as being pointed in the right direction.
